# Distributed Systems Projects Repository

This repository contains all the distributed systems projects developed as part of the Distributed Systems course.  
It includes implementations based on **Message Queues**, **Sockets**, **RPC**, a **Final Hybrid System**, and a **Conceptual Parking Design**, along with their corresponding reports (in Spanish) and source code.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Message Queue System
- Implements a client-server architecture using **POSIX message queues**.  
- Clients send requests via a server queue; the server responds via client-specific queues.  
- Database stored in `store.txt`.  
- Includes concurrency tests with multiple threads.  
- Report in Spanish: `message-queue-system/doc/message-queue-report-spanish.pdf`.  
- Source code in `message-queue-system/src/`.

### 2. Socket-Based System
- Implements a client-server architecture using **TCP sockets**.  
- Messages are serialized to ensure compatibility across different machines.  
- Database stored in `store.txt`.  
- Includes tests for concurrent requests and mass insertion (1000 threads).  
- Report in Spanish: `socket-based-client-server/doc/socket-report-spanish.pdf`.  
- Source code in `socket-based-client-server/src/`.

### 3. RPC-Based System
- Implements a client-server architecture using **Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)**.  
- Clients call server functions remotely using RPC stubs generated by `rpcgen`.  
- Database stored in `store.txt`.  
- Includes tests for insertion, modification, deletion, and concurrent requests.  
- Report in Spanish: `rpc-based-distributed-system/doc/rpc-report-spanish.pdf`.  
- Source code in `rpc-based-distributed-system/src/`.

### 4. Peer-to-Peer Distributed Network (Hybrid: Python + C + Web Service + RPC)
- Combines multiple distributed technologies:  
  - **Python clients** communicate with the server via sockets.  
  - **C server** manages user registration, connections, publications, and file transfers.  
  - **SOAP Web Service** provides date/time information included in every client request.  
  - **RPC subsystem** logs operations remotely for monitoring.  
- Demonstrates integration of sockets, web services, and RPC in a hybrid architecture.  
- Report in Spanish: `peer-to-peer-distributed-network/doc/peer-to-peer-report-spanish.pdf`.  
- Source code in `peer-to-peer-distributed-network/src/`.

### 5. Distributed Parking Management System (Conceptual Design)
- A **conceptual project** focused on the design of a distributed system for managing access to a public parking facility.  
- Architecture: client-server model with multiple gate controllers (clients) and a central server.  
- Clients include entry/exit buttons, cameras, sensors, and display screens.  
- Server maintains vehicle database and updates free space count.  
- Communication based on socket message exchange.  
- Includes diagrams illustrating client workflow, server workflow, and system interactions.  
- Report in Spanish: `distributed-parking-management-design/doc/distributed-parking-report-spanish.pdf`.

## Usage

Each project contains its own `README.md` with:

- Compilation instructions (`Makefile` usage or Python execution)  
- How to run server and client executables  
- Test scenarios and expected outputs  
- Notes on concurrency, synchronization, and data handling  

---

## Notes

- All projects were successfully compiled and tested on Debian Virtual Lab ("Guernika").  
- The database `store.txt` is generated at runtime in each project.  
- Systems are concurrent and thread-safe, but request processing order may vary.  
- The Parking Design project is conceptual and does not include source code, only diagrams and explanations.
